              We - we roast coffee. Craft of coffee roasting is what we know
              best. We demand the same levels of commitment to know-how from all
              of the people we work with. The result of this mutual
              understanding is a full-flavoured, balanced, and easily
              recognizable taste of our coffees. We source and buy green coffees
              directly from farmers.

              We love coffee. Coffee bean is fascinating. There is nothing that
              simple and yet that difficult at the same time. Coffee is a
              multicultural phenomenon, a language understandable by most people
              on earth. Coffee is a good with a very complex character,
              multi-faceted, unpredictable. Coffee opens up only to those who
              devote to it a lot of time and energy, those who ponder over it
              and admire it.

              In specialty coffee culture an ability to properly brew coffee is
              summing it all up. In one cup of coffee we bring together efforts
              of all of those who worked on the taste of that cup. Efforts by
              farmers, pickers, those who processed, sorted and graded the
              coffee, cuppers, roasters.

              Coffee is a ritual, a small treat in the morning, "fuel", a break,
              chat, affair that makes up our lives. Making the coffee better, we
              make our lives better. With this concept in mind, our blends were
              developed by the leading professionals in the coffee industry.

              Strive for learning new things creates a forward movement, a
              self-improvement. Beauty of coffee is that it is an inexhaustible
              source of knowledge for all of those who engage with this product.
              Our daily work with green and roasted coffee provides us with
              experience and encourages us to constantly search and gather more
              knowledge from coffee growers, baristas and other roasters. All
              the knowledge we accumulate we invest in our coffees!
